# React: multiple selection sample for react-dnd

https://codesandbox.io/s/matsutoba-react-multiple-selection-dnd-btu0n

## Overview
I wanted to use react-dnd to achieve drag and drop of multiple objects.
For multiple selection, I used the "react-selecto" library.

For single dragging, I just used the function of react-dnd.

In the case of dragging after multiple selection, the selected objects determined by react-selecto were displayed on the custom layer as drag targets.
